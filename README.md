# poetree-app

Stores "Poem of The Month" (used to publish a new one every month) since Facebook got rid of their Notes feature ðŸ™„. Maybe I will add on extra features (e.g., archives) if I feel the burning desire to.

This repo includes the latest migration from legacy Ionic + NestJS to Next.js since Heroku no longer offered a free-tier option and many new advances in web frameworks and distributed technologies such as [edge computing](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/edge-network/overview) are now being offered as a better alternative option.

We currently use the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) to speed up the process from zero to production. Deployments will be managed by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - the preferred way to host Next.js apps.
